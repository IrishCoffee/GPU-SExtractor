Parallel Astronomical Source Extraction tool based on SExtractor

==========

Main contribution

In this work, we propose to use the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to accelerate source extraction. Our work is based on SExtractor, an astronomical source extraction tool widely used in astronomy projects, and study its parallelization on the GPU. In GPU-SExtractor, we re-design and parallelize each major step in SExtractor:

1) Background Computation,
2) Multi-Threshold Object Detection,
3) Object Cleaning and
4) Object Analysis.

In particular, we identify the Multi-Threshold Object Detection step as the most complex and time-consuming, and design a parallel detection algorithm based on Connected-Component Labelling. Furthermore, we apply compaction techniques to optimize the detection algorithm to
better utilize the massive GPU thread parallelism. In the Object Analysis step, we decompose the analysis into a sequence of GPU-friendly
data-parallel primitives to compute the attributes of each extracted object. We have evaluated our GPU-SExtractor in comparison with the original
SExtractor on a desktop with an Intel i7 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX670 GPU on a set of real-world and synthetic astronomical images of different sizes.
The results show that our GPU-SExtractor outperforms the original SExtractor by a factor of 6, taking a merely 1.9 second to process a typical
4KX4K image containing 167,000 celestial objects.

File description

main.c controls the entire program, i.e., Input, Filling, Checking, Convolving and Output five steps. At the end of each step, the execution time is outputted. 
gpu_kernel.cu contains several computation-intensified functions, originally located in alard.c. Both GPU kernel and GPU memory allocation can be found in gpu_kernel.cu. 
functions.c has the functions that relate to checking and turning. 
Global variables for .c and .cu files are in global.h and gforg.h, respectively.

Compile

Both HOTPANTS and P-HOTPANTS were developed on Linux. Other operating systems may require minor changes to the source code. Synthetic image is not recommended for inputs.

Modify the GPU-PART parameter in gpu_kernel.cu to set the ratio of GPU workload in Convolving.

Modify the CFITIOS and CUTIL direction in MAKEFILE before conduct ¡°make¡±.

Sample

We provide one pair of 1K x 1K images and one pair of 3K x 3K images as input, please use the following commands:

./hotpants -inim input_3K.fit -tmplim templ_3K.fit -outim resd_3K.fit -v 0

or 

./hotpants -inim input_1K.fit -tmplim templ_1K.fit -outim resd_1K.fit -v 0
